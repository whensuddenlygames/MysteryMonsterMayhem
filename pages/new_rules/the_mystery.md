# The Mystery
The reason why our silly gooses are there to begin with. To solve the mystery! Whether by chance or by request they find themselves in a spooky house, abandoned theme park, or dilapidated mall. Generally anything with a deed that some greedy capitalist wants to steal.

To solve the mystery, the players must gather clues by talking with NPCs, investigating dark rooms, or pouring over ancient tomes in cathedral sized libraries.

## Setting Up the Mystery 
Before the play session begins the players choose a level for the mystery. This determines what they must roll to solve it. It's suggested to not go below a 6. 

From here the GM will present the inciting incident and let the PCs loose.

## The Investigation 
The GM will have a list of NPCs to investigate, locations to explore, and clues to uncover at each location. PCs will use their skills and abilities to gather up these clues in order to solve the mystery. 

Talk with NPCs to discover who hates who.

Dig through decades old court documents to track the family lineage of who owned the land!

Creep through the mansion to discover its hidden passagways.

## Solving The Mystery 
The answer isn't determined ahead of time. Rather, the players gather enough clues until they believe they can build a cohesive answer using what they've gathered! For each clue, ease the level of the clue by 1. The final level is the level of the mystery + monster level - clues

Once they're ready, they must capture the monster and the unmask it! 

If the roll is successful the players describe how each clue fits together to reveal the dastardly villain behind the mask.

If it fails, the true horror is revealed, the monster is real! The players are immediately thrown into The Last Chase.
