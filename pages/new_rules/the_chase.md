# The Chase
Whenever the party fails a PANIC! roll the monster instantly appears and gives chase.

The level of the chase is the monster's level + each character's personal PANIC! level.

## Escaping
To escape, the PCs take turns describing their wacky hijinks. After their description they make their roll. If successful they are free to assist other PCs escape through further hijinks.

The PCs can attempt to daze the monster during the chase provided they feel they have enough clues to solve the mystery. See The Mystery for more details.

Once the chase is over the group PANIC! resets to 0 and they have successfully gotten away from the monster--for now. However, after each chase GM Intrusions increase by 1 level. Meaning after the first chase GM Intrusions are rolled on 1s and 2s. After the second, GM Intrusions are rolled on 1s, 2s, and 3s. Etc.

## The Last Chase
If the players fail to solve the mystery they instantly enter the Last Chase. This chase works like a normal chase, excpet the PCs have only one goal--flee! The monster cannot be killed and the PCs must get to their get-away vehicle and write the place off.
