# PANIC!
When the darkness draws closer and the hot breath of a monster hits the back of your neck, the panic sets in. It grows and grows until your body takes overrides your mind and takes flight! 

Each character has their own PANIC! level along with a group level. At the start of the Mystery, eash is set to 0. Through the course of play this level will rise, eventually leading to a chase!

A PC's PANIC! is maxed at 3
The group PANIC! is maxed at 10.

## How PANIC! Raises

### Personal
- Whenever a PC receives enough damage equal to their Tier x 3 their PANIC! raises by 1 level.
- As the result of a Nat 1 from a GM Intrusion.
- The PC may add 1 level of PANIC! in order to re-roll one failed check.
- Anytime something particularly spooky happens!

### Group
- As the result of a Nat 1 from a GM Intrusion.
- Whenever a single PC's PANIC! level reaches their Tier + 1
- The first time the party encounters the monster (not all PCs need to be present)
- Anytime the group discovere a dead body.

## Reducing PANIC!
- As a Major Effect the player may reduce their PANIC! by 2 or group PANIC! by 2.
- As a Minor Effect the player may reduce their PANIC! by 1 or group PANIC! by 1.
- After a chase the group PANIC! resets to 0.
- PCs may lower personal PANIC! by 1 after divulging a secret about their character to the group.

## Using PANIC!
A character's personal PANIC! level contributes to the difficulty of the monster's level when determining rolls against it during the chase. See The Chase for more details.

Whenever the group PANIC! level reaches 3, the inciting player must roll against it. They may choose any stat appropriate for the roll to help ease it. If the roll fails, the PCs instantly PANIC! and a chase begins.

If the roll is successful the group PANIC! level continues to raise as normal. At level 6 the group must roll again. Then again at 9 and 10.
