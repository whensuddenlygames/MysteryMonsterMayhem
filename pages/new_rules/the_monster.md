# The Monster
> Keep this fact in mind and stress it to your players: Monsters in Mystery Monster Mayhem! are dangerous. They cannot be killed, only trapped in hopes to reveal their true nature.

A monster does not have normal HP, rather they have a number of times they can be dazed equal to their level. Once the monster has been dazed equal to their Tier lower the group PANIC! level by 2 and PC PANIC! level by 1.

PCs can daze the monster through their wacky hijinks, traps, silly plans, or smacking it around. Smacking it around is the hardest approach, as it requires the PC to deal enough "damage" equal to the monster's level x 3 to equal one daze.

Once the monster has been fully dazed they are "knocked out." The PCs can attempt to solve the mystery at this time or run!

Should they run, the monster removes a daze level for every scene that passes before meeting it again or as a consequence of a GM Intrusion.

## The Final Trap
When the party is ready to solve the mystery they set the Final Trap. The players describe their wild scheme and then roll against the monster's level - their daze level.

If the trap is successful they are now open to Solving The Mystery.

If it fails the monster removes all daze levels and deals damage equal to its level in a short range, and increases the group PANIC! level by 1.
