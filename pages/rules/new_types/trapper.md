**Special Abilities:** Choose four of the abilities listed below. You can't choose the same ability more than once unless its description says otherwise. The full description for each listed ability can be found in Abilities, which also has descriptions for flavor and focus abilities in a single vast catalog.

- Bash (1 Might point): This is a pummeling melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal to human targets and dazes them for one round, during which time all tasks it performs are hindered. For monster targets this only dazes them. Action.
- Shove (1 Might point): This melee attack inflicts 1 less point of damage to human targets, and regardless of whether you hit the target, you maneuver it into a position you desire within immediate range. For monster targets this causes no damage nor dazes them. Action.
- Improved Edge: Choose one of your Edge stats that is 0. It increases to 1. Enabler.
- Overwatch (1 Intellect point): You use a ranged weapon to target a limited area (such as a doorway, a hallway, or the eastern side of the clearing) and make an attack against the next viable target to enter that area. This works like a wait action, but you also negate any benefit the target would have from cover, position, surprise, range, illumination, or visibility. Further, you inflict 1 additional point of damage or extra daze to monsters with the attack. You can remain on overwatch as long as you wish, within reason. Action.
- Physical Skills: You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: balancing, climbing, jumping, running, or swimming. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler.
- Spring the Trap (1 Speed point): You spring the trap to catch your target. On human targets this action is eased by 1 step. Action.
- Quick Throw (2 Speed points): After using an improvised thrown light weapon, you draw another improvised light weapon and make another thrown attack against the same target or a different one. Action.
