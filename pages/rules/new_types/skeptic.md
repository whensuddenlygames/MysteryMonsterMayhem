## First-Tier Skeptic

**Effort:** Your Effort is 1. 

**Genius:** You have an Intellect Edge of 1, a Might Edge of 0, and a Speed Edge of 0. Expert 

**Cypher Use:** You can bear three cyphers at a time.

**Starting Equipment:** Appropriate clothing, plus two expensive iterms, two moderately priced items, and up to four inexpensive items of your choice.

**Weapons:** You have an inability with all weapons.

**Special Abilities:** Choose four of the abilities listed below. You can't choose the same ability more than once unless its description says otherwise. The full description for each listed ability can be found in Abilities, which also has descriptions for flavor and focus abilities in a single vast catalog.

- B.S. Goggles: You are skilled at seeing through lies and deceptions. Enabler
- Decipher (1 Intellect point): If you spend one minute examining a piece of writing or code in a language you do not understand, you can make an Intellect roll of difficulty 3 (or higher, based on the complexity of the language or code) to get the gist of the message. Action to initiate.
- Extra Skill: You are trained in one skill of your choice (other than attacks or defense) in which you are not already trained. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different skill. Enabler.
- Knowledge Skills: You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two areas of knowledge such as history, geography, archeology, and so on. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler.
- Scan (2 Intellect Points): You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or creatures within that area. The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level. You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the matter and energy in that area. For example, you might learn that the wooden box contains a device of metal and plastic. You might learn that the glass cylinder is full of poisonous gas, and that its metal stand has an electrical field running through it that connects to a metal mesh in the floor. You might learn that the creature standing before you is a mammal with a small brain. However, this ability doesn’t tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don’t know what the metal and plastic device does. In the second, you don’t know if stepping on the floor causes the cylinder to release the gas. In the third, you might suspect that the creature is not very intelligent, but scans, like looks, can be deceiving. Many materials and energy fields prevent or resist scanning. Action.
- Skeptical (1+ Intellect Point): You are naturally skeptical of all things. The first time you encounter a monster you may spend 1 intellect point to ease your PANIC! roll. If you fail the roll you can attempt it again upon meeting the monster for an additional 1 point of intellect.
- Understanding: You observe or study a creature or object. Your next interaction with that creature or object gains one asset. Action.
