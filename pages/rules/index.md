# Mystery Monster Mayhem! Rules
Thematically we're going for horror + mystery + goofy hijinks. Think Scooby-Doo meets Brindlewood Bay. You'll see this show up in the new ability names and chase rules.

Here you'll find the four new Types, the allowed Foci, and new rules for PANIC!, Chases, and building a Mystery. I'm leaving Cyphers for later. Which I know is weird considering it is in the name of the game, but I want to make sure these new rules are working as intended and then we'll go from there.
